This is a add on onto CCGM called CG+ I do not own CCGM I have not made CG+ another dev has been working on it for me. This uses the same license as CCGM and if you want to use it you must use the same license and have a open source code.
Credits. (Harpy owner of CCGM) (Gibson Dev of CG+) (Ultra Exotic Running/Helping run CG+ (Owner Of CG+)) (Beta Tester (Storm) (W mode/CuteTractorBoy) Thank you everyone for making this possible
